# save-your-tears-
the weekend is goat
i saw u dancing in the crowded room
you looked so happy when i"m not with you
but then you saw me by surpise
a single tear drop falling from your eyes
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
